# lzjbn
Javascript Compression Library designed for speed.

### This is a NODE.JS, IO.JS & Browser compatible real-time compression library.

## This project is now no longer  being enhanced; but pull requests will be honored if relevant as this is the fastest version of LZJB.
The reason this project is no longer maintained is because, about two years after I worked on this and optimized it, I found another project that is way better.

I wrote about this LZJBN project in the following [fluentReports Blog](http://fluentreports.com/blog/?p=18) post.

I wrote a followup post on the way better compression at this [fluentReports Blog](http://fluentreports.com/blog/?p=39) post and you can find that project at [https://github.com/pierrec/node-lz4](https://github.com/pierrec/node-lz4)
